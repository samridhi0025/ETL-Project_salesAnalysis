This project demonstrates a complete **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** pipeline built using **Python and SQL Server**, showcasing data engineering and analytics capabilities. We automate data extraction from **Kaggle**, clean and transform it using **Pandas**, load it into **SQL Server**, and finally run **SQL queries** to derive business insights.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

- **Extract**: Fetch dataset from Kaggle using the Kaggle API.
- **Transform**: Clean and process the data using Pandas (handling missing values, formatting, column renaming).
- **Load**: Insert the cleaned data into a Microsoft SQL Server database.
- **Analyze**: Use SQL queries to answer business questions from the loaded data.

## ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python** (Jupyter Notebook)
- **Pandas**
- **Kaggle API**
- **SQL Server**
- **SQLAlchemy**

## ðŸš€ Steps Performed

1. **Kaggle API Setup**  
   - Installed and authenticated the Kaggle API  
   - Programmatically downloaded the dataset

2. **Data Cleaning with Pandas**  
   - Dropped nulls and unnecessary columns  
   - Renamed columns for clarity  
   - Converted data types

3. **Database Setup & Connection**  
   - Created a new database in **SQL Server**  
   - Used `SQLAlchemy` to connect  
   - Created SQL tables and inserted cleaned data

4. **Data Analysis with SQL**  
   - Answered real-world questions like:
     - Total revenue
     - Best-selling products
     - Monthly sales trends
     - Average discount per order
